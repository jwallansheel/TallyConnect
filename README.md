Hey Guys,
this is a small project i got to build alongside my work while practicing asp.net .
This application can connect to Tally ERP9 servers (local /Client) with some changes in code, and display required class /voucher/bill form . 
uses ODBC connection to link MS excel, ASP.net app and Tally erp9.
